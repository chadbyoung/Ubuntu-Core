description: This is a message broker that supports version 3.1 and 3.1.1 of the MQTT
  protocol.  MQTT provides a method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe
  model. It is lightweight, both in terms of bandwidth usage and ease of implementation.
  This makes it particularly useful at the edge of the network where a sensor or other
  simple device may be implemented using an arduino for example.
